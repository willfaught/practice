/*
Problem:
Have an array of stock prices over time.
Determine the most profit to be had from one buy and then one sell.

Assumptions:
Prices >= 0. Prices can go up, down, stay the same. At least one price.
Can buy and sell on same day (0 profit).

Examples:
9 1 5 2 6 4
1 2 3 4 5
3 2 1 4 5
6 10 [4] 1 2 3 4 5 6 [5]

Options:
Brute force, compare every buy/sell pair: constant space, but quadratic time
Track max profit, scan forward from smallest known min: constant space, linear time

Solution:
Track max profit, scan forward from smallest known min

Time: O(N), N=price comparisons
Space: O(1), 1=max profit
