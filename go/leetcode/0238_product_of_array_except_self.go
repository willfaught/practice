Problem:
Given slice of integers where len >= 2, produce new slice where newslice[i]
is the product of all integers in oldslice except oldslice[i]. All products
will fit in 32 bits. Must not use division. Must be linear time.

Assumptions:
All products will fit in 32-bit signed ints. Input can be mutated.

Examples:
1 2 -> 2 1
1 2 3 -> 6 3 2
5 5 5 -> 25 25 25
3 0 6 -> 0 18 0
-5 2 3 -> 6 -15 -10

1   2   3  4  5
-----------------
1   2   6  24 120 (prefix products)
120 120 60 20 5   (suffix products)
-----------------
120 60  40 30 24  (products)

Options:
Bruce force, for each index, iterate all other indexes and calc product: constant space, but quadratic time (won't work, slower than linear time)
Calc total product, divide by each int (won't work, uses division)
Calc prefix/suffix products per index, mult prefix/suffix products from either side
of index: linear time, constant space (not including input/output)

Solution:
Calc prefix/suffix products per index, mult prefix/suffix products from either side
of index

Time: O(N), N=prefix product multiplications
Space: O(1), 1=scalar local vars
